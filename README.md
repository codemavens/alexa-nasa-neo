This is a simple Alexa skill that uses the Nasa NEO api to list the top threats to earth each day.

Future enhancements I'd like to make:
- List the rest of the threats each day 
- Cache the Nasa API results in a data store to improve response time and minimize hits to the api
- List threats for any arbitrary day
- Migrate from Azure to AWS
